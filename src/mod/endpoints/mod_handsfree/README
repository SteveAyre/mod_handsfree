Installation requires bluez and ofono, recent enough to have the file descriptor passing feature.

Version tested: 

ofono-0.29
bluez-4.72

-- Installation --

Just do a regular FreeSWITCH installation.

mod_handsfree must be uncommented in modules.conf

-- Configuration --
See src/mod/endpoints/mod_handsfree/handsfree.conf.xml

-- Limitations --

- No outbound dialing yet, easy to add, just requires a bit more work.
- only works for 1 modem. I need to update the python scripts to accept modem name as argument
- bluez-path in configuration must be provided, eventually can be automatically found or at least
  made much easier only requiring the adapter interface
- Not very tolerant to errors, I need to add code to determine if ofono daemon is running and whether
  the modems are connected or not. If one script fails, I don't check for failures to give useful output.
