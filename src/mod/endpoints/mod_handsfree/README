Installation requires bluez and ofono, recent enough to have the file descriptor passing feature.

Version tested: 

ofono-0.29
bluez-4.72

-- Installation --

Just do a regular FreeSWITCH installation.

mod_handsfree must be uncommented in modules.conf

-- Configuration --
See src/mod/endpoints/mod_handsfree/handsfree.conf.xml
copy all src/mod/endpoints/mod_handsfree/scripts/ contents to ${prefix}/scripts (typically /usr/local/freeswitch/scripts)

-- Limitations --
- Not very tolerant to errors in ofono, I need to add code to determine if ofono daemon is running and whether
  the modems are connected or not. If one script fails, I don't check for failures to give useful output.
